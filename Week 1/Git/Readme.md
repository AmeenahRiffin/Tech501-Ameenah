## Day 2: 

### Git Fundamentals

Git Bash was introduced, and as a refresher I went over the bash commands and navigating through it.

We were also shown how to stage and unstage our commits.

We were then introduced to Git Bash and how to use it to navigate the command line, this led to the creation of this repository on Github.

### Commands

* To add a file to staging: `git add <filename>`
* To add all changes to staging: `git add .`
* To commit changes: `git commit -m "<commit message>"`
* To push changes to repository: `git push`
* To pull updated files from repository: `git pull`
