## Day 1: Presentations and Introduction to DevOps

We were introduced to the DevOps concept and asked to research the aims and cycle of DevOps. We watched a video on presentation styles and were given a group task assignment to create a presentation on that topic.

We created a presentation on the topic of "DevOps in a Nutshell" to present for the next day.
