## T-Shaped Professional

We were introduced to the concept of the T-shaped professional.

A T-Shaped Professional is a person who has a wide range of skills across multiple areas, but is also very skilled in one specific area. 

Whereas a V-shaped professional is a person who is very skilled in one specific area, but has a limited range of skills.

In a DevOps team, the T-shaped professional is the ideal type of person to have, as they are able to work in a wider range of roles and are more adaptable to change.

Depending on the size of the team, the T-shaped professional may be able to take on more than one role, such as a DevOps engineer who is also a developer. It could also be a team of T-shaped professionals, where each person has a different skill set.
