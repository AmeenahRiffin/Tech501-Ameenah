### The Cloud / Azure

We had a presentation called "What is the Cloud?", and how it works. We were introduced to Azure and how it works.

**"What is the Cloud?"**
- VMs, storage, networking (Vnets), and databases
- Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet
- Resources are provided as services, and are available to users on demand so you only pay for what you use

On-Premise vs. Cloud Computing

#### On-Premise (Traditional)
- Your organization owns and manages everything
- Big upfront costs to buy equipment
- Limited by your physical hardware
- You have complete control
- Need your own IT team for maintenance

#### Cloud Computing
- Cloud provider (like Azure) owns and runs everything
- Only pay for what you actually use
- Can easily grow or shrink resources as needed
- Share control with the provider
- Provider handles most of the maintenance work
