### Agile

We were introduced to Agile and how it works in the software development cycle and how it can be used to improve the development process, and how that ties into DevOps. We also learned about the difference between Agile and Waterfall. Scrum was also elaborated on.


### Notes on Agile

Agile methods are important for DevOps engineers and make your skills more useful as teams get better at using agile.

Interestingly! - Also learned that Agile and Agile methodologies are not the same thing, and that Agile is a mindset. 

Agile methods are important for DevOps engineers and make your skills more useful as teams get better at using agile. You might work directly on a development team or across several teams, depending on the companyâ€™s budget. Agile helps us work smoothly and get things done over a long period of time.
