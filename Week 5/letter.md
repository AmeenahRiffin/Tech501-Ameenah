Dear Future Spartan,

Congratulations on starting your journey with Sparta Global! As a recent graduate, I'd like to share some key advice that helped me succeed.

The training is intense and fast-paced. Stay organized and review regularly to keep up with the material. I prefer to keep my separate weeks and topics in separate folders, for ease. 

Tips I would generally recommend:
- Take detailed notes and review daily, even if it's just a few minutes.
- Ask questions when you need clarification - don't be shy, participation is encouraged.
- Be communicative and punctual, it will be noticed and appreciated.
- Work with your fellow trainees.
- Most importantly - keep a positive mindset.

Remember that soft skills like communication and teamwork are just as important as technical abilities. Manage your time well, break down complex topics into smaller parts - sometimes making notes breaking things down to bullet points when making notes can help.

During your training, you may find yourself needing help, it is a good way to communicate and form a good rapport with your fellow classmates, they will help you - use it when needed. 

Stay committed and focus on your strengths and identify your weaknesses to improve on, and you gain confidence with your successes.

Best of luck!

Kind regards,
Ameenah Riffin
