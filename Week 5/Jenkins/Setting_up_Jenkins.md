## Progress Report on Jenkins Server Setup

So far, I have:
- Create the new GitHub repository "CICD-with-own-Jenkins-project"
- Set up an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS server
- Installed Java 17 on the server
- Added the Jenkins repository and its key


What I still need to do:
1. Install Jenkins
2. Start and enable the Jenkins service
3.  Configure Jenkins through the web interface
4. Set up the required environments:
   - Node JS 20 for the Sparta test app
   - Java 17 and MySQL for the World API
5. Build the Jenkins pipeline for app deployment
6. Create documentation including:
   - Setup instructions
   - Jenkins pipeline diagram
   - General process diagram
7. Record the 5-7 minute demonstration video showing:
   - Jenkins build process
   - Environment setup
   - Pipeline rebuild steps
