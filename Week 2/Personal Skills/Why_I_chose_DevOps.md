# Improv script for why I chose DevOps

Hi, I'm Ameenah. I made the switch to DevOps from my background in software development and housing customer service.

In my previous roles, I saw two different sides of technology - building software and helping people use systems effectively. What really drew me to DevOps was how it brings these worlds together.

From my software development experience, I understand the challenges of writing code and getting it to work properly. And from customer service - especially within the housing sector, I learned just how important it is to have reliable systems that actually help users do their jobs. A lot of the systems and services in the public sector are old, unreliable, and hard to use.

DevOps feels like the perfect blend of both worlds. It's about making the whole process smoother - from writing code to deploying it to maintaining it in production. I love that it focuses on automation and continuous improvement, which means less manual work and fewer headaches for everyone involved.

The collaborative nature of DevOps also really appeals to me. My background has taught me how important good communication and teamwork are. 

So that's why I chose DevOps - it lets me use both my technical skills and my collaboration skills to help people get the most out of their technology, and make people's lives easier. I'm excited to keep learning and growing, as I'm learning new things every day.
