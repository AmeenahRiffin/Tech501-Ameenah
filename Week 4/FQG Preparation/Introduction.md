Slide 1 - Introduction

Hi there! I'm Ameenah. I'm a tech enthusiast with a background in housing administration and customer service. My journey into DevOps started when I was working in business operations and noticed how many processes could be improved through technology. 

Outside of tech, I enjoy:
- Digital Art

Slide 2 - Making Your App More Secure
Title: How We Keep Your Data Safe

Think of our system like a house with two separate rooms:
- Room 1 (The Front Room):
  * Where users can access our friendly web application
  * Just like your living room where guests are welcome!
- Room 2 (The Vault):
  * Where we safely store all your important data
  * Like a secure vault that only authorized staff can access

Why is this good for you?
  * Your data stays extra safe - just like keeping valuables in a vault
  * Everything runs smoothly - no traffic jams!
  * We can grow bigger without any hiccups when more users join
